    Specific, clear and unambiguous
    Measurable, using numbers or something that can be broken down into steps 
    Actionable, it needs to be immediately clear what action needs to be taken to accomplish the goal
    Achievable given external constraints and factors
    Relevant, in service of your bigger goals
    Realistic, something you can develop a high confidence in achieving 
    Timely, not necessarily time bound but not very far off goals
    Evaluate, read every week and evaluate them every month
